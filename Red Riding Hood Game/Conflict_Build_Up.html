		<h1>Little Red Riding Hood Story</h1>
		<p>
			You meet a dashing huntsboy named Roy and you chat with him for a while. He asks you if you need any help going to Grandma's. You say it's okay, but little do you know that the wolf is hiding behind the trees, listening onto the conversation. The wolf then decides to disguise himself as Roy. Roy says bye and you head on your way.
			As you walk, you get really tired and are surprised to see the Roy again. He says "Well, I'm going to help you anyways!"
